The Midnight Quaint
</h1></strong></p><p><br></p><p>

The hour dark, when shadows wane,
Time when lights gaze fades,
Heavy hours, silence reigns,
Dawns queen abstains.
Such time of delight, night,
Calming, chilling hour of fright,
In my rest, sound abounds my ears,
Witching hour reveals my fears.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Shadow looms beyond my windows light,
A frightful sight, a creature of the night,
Knock, knocking on my sealed apertured wall,
I cry, “Beast of Noc, cease your knocking on my chambered hall.”
</p><p><br></p><p>

In the gloom, I strain to see,
What manner of beast disturbs my peace,
The window creaks, shadows sway,
As midnight whispers start to play.
</p><p><br></p><p>

A figure pale, with eyes so deep,
In the corner, where moonlight sleeps,
Through the frame, it slips with grace,
A wraithly smile upon its face.
</p><p><br></p><p>

“Good sir,” it croons with voice of frost,
“Your slumbers peace is nearly lost,
For I, a wanderer of the dusk,
Seek refuge from dawns cruel musk.”
</p><p><br></p><p>

Its gaze, a chill upon my skin,
As it beckons me to let it in,
I shudder with a wary dread,
No mortal sleep can quell my dread.
</p><p><br></p><p>

“Begone!” I plead, “Return to shade,
Where mortal fears and dusk are laid,”
But still it stands, its presence near,
A whispering shade, a creeping fear.
</p><p><br></p><p>

“No solace here,” it softly sighs,
“Your chambers warmth and weary eyes,
May beckon me, but understand,
I am not of your living land.”
</p><p><br></p><p>

Thus the night, its silence breaks,
With softest plea and chilling stakes,
Through my window, it finds its way,
Until the dawn ends its stay.
</p><p><br></p><p>

In twilights fading grace,
It vanishes without a trace,
And I am left with haunting thought,
Of midnights guest, and taxes fought.
