TERMINUS EST
&quot;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>

Before Severian was banished from the Citadel, Master Palaemon gave him Terminus Est -- A large two-handed executioner's sword, black as obsidian and near as sharp. It served as a symbol of his authority as a former high ranking member of the Torturer's Guild, and as a deadly tool during his yils as a travelling executioner. <br>
Despite its utility, the sword was extremely ostentatious -- "as art had been lavished upon her" according to historians. Severian took meticulous care of the sword, cleaning, oiling, and sharpening the blade before and after every execution, to the point where he used Terminus Est to shave with, forgoing a razor.

As any sword of justice, Terminus Est has a square and blunted end and therefore cannot be effectively used as a thrusting weapon, but is made unique by its specialty design... Wielders of Terminus Est describe it as being "Light to raise, and weighty to descend", in part due to a hollow channel in the spine of the blade containing liquid quicksilver, giving it an excellent shift in balance for delivering overhead strikes during executions, less so for combat unless the wielder is very familiar with it.

Terminus Est is recorded as being the last work of a master swordsmith. The name "Terminus Est" can be roughly translated to "It is finished."
